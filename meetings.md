* **DATE:** 15.02.2019
* **ASSISTANTS:** Mika Oja

### Minutes
The text explaining our main concepts and relations was rather dense and lacked a diagram. Our API use cases were mostly listing human interfaces. We should focus more on machine clients to make things easier for the future.

### Action points
* Make diagram for concepts
* Create API uses cases that are more related to machine clients rather than human interfaces
